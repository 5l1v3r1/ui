# ui

This is the official [bettercap](https://www.bettercap.org/)'s web UI, **this project is still work in progress**. 

## Prerequisites

- node
- npm

## Getting Started

In order to run the web ui, first clone the repo somewhere and build the source:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/bettercap/ui.git ~/ui
cd ~/ui
npm i --save
ng build --prod 
```

This shoud generate the `~/ui/dist/ui` folder, then you can use `bettercap` (make sure it's updated) for both the REST API and to serve the web ui itself via the `http.server` module:

```sh
sudo bettercap
```

Then from bettercap's interactive session, enable a few modules:

```
wifi.recon on 
ble.recon on
hid.recon on
```

Setup the `api.rest` module (change these default credentials!):

```
set api.rest.username changeme 
set api.rest.password changeme 
api.rest on
```

And start serving the UI (by default on port 80 of the IP address of the interface):

```
set http.server.address 127.0.0.1
set http.server.path /path/to/ui/dist/ui 
http.server on
```

The UI will be available at `http://127.0.0.1/`, you can login with the credentials provided to `api.rest`.
