This is the official [bettercap](https://www.bettercap.org/)'s web UI, **this project is still work in progress**. 

## Building from Sources

Assuming you have `make`, `node` and `npm` correctly installed, first clone the repo somewhere, build the source and install to `/usr/local/share/bettercap/ui`:

cd ~/ui
make build
sudo make install
